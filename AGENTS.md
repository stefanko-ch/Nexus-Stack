# Nexus-Stack - Agent Instructions

## Language

**Always respond and generate code in English**, even if the user writes in German or another language. This includes:
- Code comments
- Variable/function names
- Commit messages
- Documentation
- README content

## Emoji Usage

**Use emojis sparingly and only where they add value:**
- Avoid excessive emojis in commit messages, PR descriptions, and documentation
- Use emojis only when they improve readability or highlight important sections
- Prefer clear, descriptive text over emoji-heavy content
- In code comments: Use emojis only for visual markers (e.g., `// ⚠️ Warning:` or `// ✅ Success`)
- In documentation: Use emojis sparingly in section headers or callouts

## Key Commands

```bash
make init    # First-time setup (creates config, initializes tofu)
make up      # Deploy everything (infrastructure + containers)
make down    # Destroy all infrastructure
make status  # Show running containers
make ssh     # SSH into server via Cloudflare Tunnel
make logs    # View container logs
make plan    # Preview infrastructure changes
make urls    # Show service URLs
make secrets # Show all service credentials
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Terraform/OpenTofu**: Use 2-space indentation, descriptive resource names with `${local.resource_prefix}` prefix
- **Bash scripts**: Use `set -e`, include colored output with emoji for user feedback
- **Docker Compose**: Always use `networks: app-network` (external), include `restart: unless-stopped`
- **Comments**: Use section headers with `# =====` separators for major sections

### Security Principles

1. **Never commit secrets** - API tokens, passwords go in `config.tfvars` (gitignored)
2. **Zero open ports** - All traffic through Cloudflare Tunnel, no direct SSH
3. **Cloudflare Access** - All services behind email OTP authentication by default
4. **Minimal permissions** - Cloudflare API tokens should have only required permissions
5. **Centralized secrets** - All service passwords generated by OpenTofu, pushed to Infisical
6. **NEVER print secrets to logs** - This is CRITICAL for public repositories:
   - Never `echo` passwords, tokens, API keys, or secrets
   - Never print API responses that may contain tokens
   - Never include credentials in error messages
   - Use `(from Infisical)` or `Credentials available in Infisical` instead
   - Always use `::add-mask::` in GitHub Actions for dynamic secrets
   - Bad: `echo "Password: $ADMIN_PASS"`
   - Good: `echo "Credentials available in Infisical"`

### Adding New Stacks

When adding a new Docker stack, **all locations must be updated**:

1. **Create the Docker Compose file:**
   - Create `stacks/<stack-name>/docker-compose.yml`
   - Use unique port (check existing stacks for used ports)
   - Include `networks: app-network` (external: true)
   - Add descriptive header comment with service URL

2. **Register the service in Terraform:**
   - Add to `services` map in `tofu/config.tfvars.example` (for documentation)
   - Add to `services` map in `tofu/stack/config.tfvars` (for deployment)
   - Use matching port number from docker-compose.yml

3. **Update README.md:**
   - Add stack badge in the "Available Stacks" badges section
   - Add row to the "Available Stacks" table with description and website link

4. **Add admin credentials (if service has admin UI):**
   - Add `random_password.<service>_admin` resource in `tofu/stack/main.tf`
   - Add password to `secrets` output in `tofu/stack/outputs.tf`
   - Add auto-setup API call in `scripts/deploy.sh` (Step 6/6)
   - Add password to Infisical secrets push payload
   - Update `make secrets` command in `Makefile`

**Badge format:**
```markdown
![StackName](https://img.shields.io/badge/StackName-COLOR?logo=LOGO&logoColor=white)
```
Find logos at [simpleicons.org](https://simpleicons.org/)

**Example service entry:**
```hcl
portainer = {
  enabled   = true
  subdomain = "portainer"    # → https://portainer.domain.com
  port      = 9090           # Must match docker-compose port
  public    = false          # false = requires Cloudflare Access login
}
```

**Example password resource (in main.tf):**
```hcl
resource "random_password" "myservice_admin" {
  length  = 24
  special = false
}
```

**Example auto-setup (in deploy.sh):**
```bash
if echo "$ENABLED_SERVICES" | grep -qw "myservice" && [ -n "$MYSERVICE_PASS" ]; then
    echo "  Configuring MyService admin..."
    # Call service's admin setup API
    curl -s -X POST 'http://localhost:PORT/api/setup' \
        -d '{"username":"admin","password":"'$MYSERVICE_PASS'"}'
fi
```

> **Note:** The `services` map in tfvars configures Cloudflare (DNS, Tunnel, Access), while the `stacks/` folder contains the Docker Compose definitions. Both must be in sync.

### Sensitive Data Handling

- `*.tfvars` files are gitignored (except `*.example`)
- `terraform.tfstate` contains sensitive data - gitignored
- Never echo API tokens or secrets in scripts
- Use `sensitive = true` for Terraform variables containing secrets
- All service passwords are stored in Infisical after deployment

## Build & Validation

### Prerequisites Check
```bash
# Verify tools are installed
which tofu cloudflared docker
```

### Test Infrastructure Changes
```bash
cd tofu && tofu plan -var-file=config.tfvars
```

### Validate Terraform Syntax
```bash
cd tofu && tofu validate
```

### Mandatory Testing

**Every change must be tested before committing.** This includes:
- `make plan` to verify infrastructure changes
- `make up` to test full deployment
- Verify services are accessible via their URLs
- Check `make secrets` shows correct credentials
- Test auto-setup worked (login with generated credentials)

## Debugging Best Practices

**When something doesn't work, think outside the box!**

### 0. Systematic Error Analysis (CRITICAL)

**NEVER jump to conclusions or make assumptions when encountering an error.**

Before attempting any fix, perform a comprehensive analysis:

1. **Gather ALL relevant information first:**
   - Read the COMPLETE error message, not just the first line
   - Check logs from ALL involved systems (GitHub Actions, Terraform, Server, Cloudflare)
   - Identify the EXACT point of failure in the execution flow

2. **Analyze the fundamentals before complex causes:**
   - Verify basic connectivity (IP addresses, ports, DNS)
   - Check data formats and types (e.g., IPv6 `/64` network vs host address)
   - Confirm variable values are what you expect them to be
   - Validate file paths, permissions, and existence

3. **Consult documentation when dealing with:**
   - Provider-specific behavior (Hetzner, Cloudflare, etc.)
   - API response formats and data structures
   - Platform-specific quirks (e.g., GitHub Actions environment)

4. **Create a hypothesis list:**
   - List ALL possible causes, from simple to complex
   - Start investigating from the most fundamental (network, data format)
   - Don't skip "obvious" checks - they're often the actual problem

5. **Example of what NOT to do:**
   - ❌ "SSH fails → must be Service Token issue" (skipped checking IP format)
   - ❌ "Connection timeout → must be firewall" (didn't verify the IP was valid)
   - ❌ "Auth failed → token not propagated" (didn't check if tunnel was running)

6. **Example of proper analysis:**
   - ✅ "SSH fails → What IP is being used? → `2a01:4f8:xxxx::/64` → That's a network, not a host! → Fix: append `::1`"

**Remember: The simplest explanation is often correct. Check the basics FIRST.**

### 1. Always Check Logs First

Before assuming client-side issues (DNS cache, browser cache, etc.), check:
- GitHub Actions workflow logs (full output, not just summary)
- Terraform/OpenTofu apply output
- Container logs on the server

### 2. Verify Infrastructure Configuration

Many issues stem from missing or misconfigured Terraform resources. Check:
- All required resources exist (not just the obvious ones)
- Resource dependencies are correctly configured
- Provider-specific requirements are met

### 3. Cloudflare-Specific Gotchas

| Service | Requirement | Common Mistake |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Cloudflare Pages** | Requires `cloudflare_pages_domain` resource | CNAME alone is NOT enough for custom domains |
| **Cloudflare Tunnel** | Requires `cloudflare_tunnel_config` | Just creating tunnel doesn't route traffic |
| **Cloudflare Access** | Requires `cloudflare_access_application` | DNS + tunnel doesn't add authentication |

**Example: Cloudflare Pages Custom Domain**
```hcl
# CNAME record alone does NOT work!
resource "cloudflare_record" "control_plane" {
  name  = "control"
  type  = "CNAME"
  value = "${local.resource_prefix}-control.pages.dev"  # e.g., nexus-stefanko-ch-control.pages.dev
}

# You ALSO need this resource:
resource "cloudflare_pages_domain" "control_plane" {
  account_id   = var.cloudflare_account_id
  project_name = cloudflare_pages_project.control_plane.name
  domain       = "control.${var.domain}"
}
```

### 4. Debugging Workflow

1. **Check the logs** - Read them thoroughly, not just "it succeeded"
2. **Verify all resources exist** - Use `tofu state list` to check what was created
3. **Check provider documentation** - Understand ALL required resources
4. **Test the underlying service** - e.g., Pages works at `*.pages.dev` but not custom domain
5. **Only then consider client-side** - DNS cache, browser cache, etc.

### 5. Don't Assume - Verify

- Don't assume DNS propagation delay - use `dig` or `nslookup` to check
- Don't assume "it was created" means "it's configured correctly"
- Don't assume one resource handles everything - many services need multiple resources

## Common Patterns

### Resource Naming
All Hetzner/Cloudflare resources use `${local.resource_prefix}` prefix (derived from domain, e.g., `nexus-stefanko-ch`):
- Server: `nexus-stefanko-ch`
- Firewall: `nexus-stefanko-ch-fw`
- SSH Key: `nexus-stefanko-ch-key`
- Tunnel: `nexus-stefanko-ch`
- Access Apps: `nexus-stefanko-ch <ServiceName>`
- KV Namespace: `nexus-stefanko-ch-kv`
- Worker: `nexus-stefanko-ch-worker`
- Pages Project: `nexus-stefanko-ch-control`

### Service Configuration
Services are defined in `config.tfvars`:
```hcl
services = {
  service-name = {
    enabled   = true
    subdomain = "app"      # → https://app.domain.com
    port      = 8080       # Must match docker-compose
    public    = false      # false = requires Cloudflare Access login
  }
}
```

### Docker Network
All services must join the external `app-network`:
```yaml
networks:
  app-network:
    external: true
```

## Commit Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). All commit messages must follow this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

### Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature | `feat(stacks): Add Apache Spark integration` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `fix: Correct Grafana port mapping` |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring | `refactor: Simplify deploy script` |
| `docs` | Documentation | `docs: Update installation instructions` |
| `chore` | Maintenance | `chore: Update dependencies` |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes | `ci: Add release workflow` |

### Scopes (optional)

| Scope | Use for |
|-------|---------|
| `stacks` | Docker stack changes |
| `tofu` | OpenTofu/Infrastructure changes |
| `docs` | Documentation |
| `ci` | GitHub Actions / CI |
| `scripts` | Shell scripts |

### Breaking Changes

Add `!` after the type for breaking changes:
```bash
feat!: Change secret management to Vault-only
```

See [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for full details.

## Git Workflow

**Never commit directly to the `main` branch.** The `main` branch is protected and should only be modified via Pull Requests.

**Never merge Pull Requests.** PRs must go through Copilot code review first. Only create PRs and push commits - the user will merge after review passes.

**Do NOT automatically create Pull Requests.** Wait for the user to explicitly request a PR before creating one. The user may want to make additional changes, test locally, or review the commits first.

### PR Titles for Release Notes

**PR titles are used to generate release notes.** The release pipeline extracts PR titles (not individual commits) to create the changelog. Therefore:

- **PR titles must follow Conventional Commits format**: `type(scope): description`
- The PR title determines the changelog category (Features, Bug Fixes, etc.)
- Individual commits within a PR can be WIP or fix-ups - only the PR title matters

**Examples:**
```
feat(stacks): Add Excalidraw whiteboard stack     → Listed under "🚀 Features"
fix(ci): Use PR titles for release notes          → Listed under "🐛 Bug Fixes"
docs: Update setup guide for R2 state backend     → Listed under "📚 Documentation"
```

**Bad examples (avoid):**
```
Update files                    → No conventional commit prefix
WIP: still working on it        → Not descriptive
Merge branch 'main' into feat   → Merge commits should not be PR titles
```

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   ```

2. Make changes and commit with conventional commits:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
   ```

3. Push and create a Pull Request:
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/my-feature
   ```

4. After PR review and merge → Release is created automatically

### Responding to PR Review Comments

**When addressing PR review comments, respond directly to each individual comment, not with a summary comment.**

- Use `gh api` to reply to each review comment thread
- Each fix should be addressed with a direct reply to the specific comment
- This creates clear traceability between comments and fixes
- Only use summary comments if explicitly requested by the reviewer

**How to reply directly to a PR review comment:**

```bash
# 1. Get the comment ID from the PR review comments
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments

# 2. Reply to a specific comment using in_reply_to
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments \
  -X POST \
  -f body="Fixed in commit abc1234 - description of fix" \
  -F in_reply_to=COMMENT_ID
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Reply to comment ID 2695714963 on PR #97
gh api repos/stefanko-ch/Nexus-Stack/pulls/97/comments \
  -X POST \
  -f body="Fixed in commit 53fa498 - removed redundant text." \
  -F in_reply_to=2695714963
```

**Workflow:**
1. Get all PR review comments: `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR/comments`
2. Fix each issue in code
3. Commit fixes with descriptive message
4. Reply directly to each comment thread with the commit reference
5. Push changes

### Branch Naming

Use prefixes that match commit types:
- `feat/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

## Important Notes

- This is a **public open-source project** - code should be clean, well-documented, and secure
- **Never commit directly to `main`** - always use feature branches and PRs
- Target platform is **macOS** for local development
- Server runs **Ubuntu 24.04**
- Always test changes before committing
- Keep README.md updated when adding features
- Follow best security practices to protect sensitive data
- Follow Conventional Commits for all commit messages
- Always adapt documentation to reflect any changes made

## Closing Issues via PRs

Use keywords in PR descriptions to automatically close issues when merged:

```markdown
Closes #7
Closes #4
Fixes #3
```

This creates a clear link between PRs and the issues they resolve.

## Creating GitHub Issues and Pull Requests

**Problem:** Heredoc syntax (`<< 'EOF'`) in terminal commands causes parsing issues and garbled output.

**Solution:** Use the `create_file` tool to write the body file, then run `gh` command separately:

```bash
# Step 1: Use create_file tool to write body
create_file("/tmp/pr-body.md", "## Summary\n\nDescription here...")

# Step 2: Run gh command in terminal
gh pr create --title "feat: Title here" --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md

# Step 3: Clean up
rm /tmp/pr-body.md
```

**NEVER use heredoc in terminal:**
```bash
# BAD - causes garbled output in this environment
cat > /tmp/body.md << 'EOF'
content
EOF

# GOOD - use create_file tool instead
# (Assume /tmp/body.md was created with the create_file tool)
gh pr create --title "feat: Title here" --body-file /tmp/body.md
rm /tmp/body.md
```

**Important:**
- Always use `create_file` tool for multiline content (PR body, issue body)
- Use `/tmp/` directory for temp files (not in repo)
- Always clean up temp files after with `rm`
- The `--body-file` flag works reliably with files created by `create_file`
