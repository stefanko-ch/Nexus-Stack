```hcl
services = {
  # ... existing services ...
  
  uptime-kuma = {
    enabled   = true
    subdomain = "uptime-kuma"    # → https://uptime-kuma.yourdomain.com
    port      = 3001        # Must match docker-compose port
    public    = false       # false = requires login
  }
}
```

Then deploy:

```bash
make up
```
