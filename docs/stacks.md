## Enabling a Stack

To enable any stack, add it to your `tofu/config.tfvars`:

```hcl
services = {
  # ... existing services ...
  
  uptime-kuma = {
    enabled   = true
    subdomain = "uptime-kuma"    # → https://uptime-kuma.yourdomain.com
    port      = 3001        # Must match docker-compose port
    public    = false       # false = requires login
  }
}
```

Then deploy via **Spin Up** workflow in GitHub Actions or through the Control Plane.

---

## Adding New Services

Adding a new service requires **2 steps**:

### 1. Create the Docker Compose stack

```bash
mkdir -p stacks/my-app
```

Create `stacks/my-app/docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  my-app:
    image: my-app-image:latest
    container_name: my-app
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8090:80"  # Pick an unused port
    networks:
      - app-network

networks:
  app-network:
    external: true
```

### 2. Add to services.tfvars

Add to `tofu/services.tfvars`:

```hcl
services = {
  # ... existing services ...
  
  my-app = {
    enabled     = true
    subdomain   = "my-app"     # → https://my-app.yourdomain.com
    port        = 8090         # Must match docker-compose port
    public      = false        # false = requires login, true = public
    description = "My awesome application"
  }
}
```

### 3. Deploy

Run the **Spin Up** workflow via GitHub Actions or use the Control Plane.

That's it! OpenTofu automatically creates:
- ✅ DNS record
- ✅ Tunnel ingress route
- ✅ Cloudflare Access application
- ✅ Access policy (email-based auth)

---

## Disabling Services

Services can be disabled via the **Control Plane** web interface, or by setting `enabled = false` in `services.tfvars`.

When disabled:
1. DNS record is removed from Cloudflare
2. Tunnel ingress route is removed
3. Cloudflare Access application and policy are removed
4. Docker container is stopped
5. Stack folder is deleted from the server

The service is completely cleaned up - no orphaned resources.
