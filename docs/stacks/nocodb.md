**Open-source Airtable alternative**

NocoDB turns any database into a smart spreadsheet with a modern web UI. Unlike read-only BI tools, NocoDB lets you create, edit, and manage data directly through multiple view types. Features include:
- Grid, Gallery, Kanban, Form, and Calendar views
- REST API auto-generated for every table
- Webhooks and automations
- Role-based access control
- File attachments and rich field types
- Import from CSV, Excel, and Airtable
